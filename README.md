# YOUTUBE-VIDEO-DOWNLOADER

**This Python script is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for downloading YouTube videos, built using the tkinter library. It uses the powerful yt-dlp library to handle the backend downloading process.**

# KEY FEATURES

+ **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and modern-styled window where users can paste a YouTube URL.

* __Video Information Fetching:__ Before downloading, the application fetches and displays the video's title, and populates dropdown menus with available video qualities (e.g., 1080p, 720p) and frame rates (FPS).

* __Customizable Downloads:__ Users can select their desired video quality and FPS, and choose a specific folder to save the downloaded file, defaulting to the user's "Downloads" folder.

* __Real-time Progress:__ A progress bar and status label provide real-time feedback on the download, showing the percentage complete, downloaded size, download speed, and estimated time remaining (ETA).

* __Download Management:__ Includes the ability to start and cancel downloads.

* __Dependency Check:__ It checks for the presence of FFmpeg on the system, which is required for merging the video and audio streams into a single MP4 file.
